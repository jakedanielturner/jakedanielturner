ðŸ‘‹  Hi, Iâ€™m @jakedanielturner. I'm a graduate software developer from the United Kingdom. I'm currently on a placement with
my graduate scheme which is run by the Central Digital and Data Office, part of the UK Government. Outside this, I'm trying
to refine my skills and delve deeper into some of the technologies I use on a day-to-day basis, such as Node.js, Typescript and AWS.
Some of my personal projects, [such as my own blog](http://jakedanielturner.co.uk), can be viewed here on Github.

ðŸ“«  I can be reached here on Github, at my email, jakedanielturner@gmail.com, or [my LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/jake-turner-3bba44160). Visit my blog to learn more about me and my graduate scheme!
