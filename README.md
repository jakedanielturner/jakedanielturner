ðŸ‘‹  Hi, Iâ€™m @jakedanielturner. I'm a student from the United Kingdom who is looking to move into software 
development once I finish my current degree. I'm doing this through a mix of things like Codecademy and FreeCodeCamp,
as well as trying to make my own little projects using the skills I am learning.

ðŸ“«  I can be reached here on Github, or at my email, jakedanielturner@gmail.com.
